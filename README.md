## Quotes app

A way for people to view Quotes. Part of what inspired me to create this project, is simply that I like short quotes, as
they seem to summarize what you believe in.
You have to be logged in to view the quotes. You can't edit or delete other people's quotes, but if you don't like
yours, then you can choose to delete or edit them!

## User Stories

## 3rd Party APIs

I used a template rails api provided by General Assembly, and built and scaffolded off that.

## Development time

I was given a week to develop this project, and two weeks before that I knew nothing about back-end, so I am very proud of how far I got given the slim time frame, getting create, read, edit, and destroy working, both on the front-end and the back-end!

This full-stack project I planned much better, and enjoyed working alongside other developers, to help guide me along when I would get stuck on something. My process for getting stuck included, googling, searching stack overflow, searching for other issues on GitHub within the project prompt's repo. If I was still stuck I would talk through my problem with other developers, and then if I still needed more guidance I would open an issue on the project repository to have an instructor of General Assembly guide me on the issue, to finally a one-on-one with an instructor. The process would be very similar, *if not* identicle to a real world development environment as a Web Application Developer.
