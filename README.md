## Introduction

SurfsApp is an application that allows the user to store data relating to their
surfing experiences. Users can store their current quiver (surfboards), create
a Session Journal, and even assign a board to a session.

The hope is that user's will be able to track which boards and which spots
they use the most.

## Using SurfsApp

SurfsApps is a very user friendly application. In order to access all featurs
users must first register and then sign in. These actions are easily visible
via the left menu column. Once logged in, users may view previous sessions,
add sessions, add boards to their quiver, or view their quiver.

Users may also add boards (by ID) to sessions (by ID).
-->Improvements pending in future versions

## Structure

SurfsApp was built with a Javascript based front-end utilizing Scss and
handlebars to facilitate rapid development and DRY code.
