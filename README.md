# Quotes app

A way for people to view Quotes. Part of what inspired me to create this project, is simply that I like short quotes, as
they seem to summarize what you believe in.
You have to be logged in to view the quotes. You can't edit or delete other people's quotes, but if you don't like
yours, then you can choose to delete or edit them!

## Development time

I was given a week to develop this project, and two weeks before that I knew nothing about back-end, so I am very proud of how far I got given the slim time frame, getting create, read, edit, and destroy working, both on the front-end and the back-end!
